    <h1>Chicken Biryani</h1>

    <p>This is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish which is often reserved for very special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. 
        It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. 
        For biryani, always use long grain rice. 
        Basmati rice with its thin, fine grains is the ideal variety to use. 
        Ghee is butter that has been slowly melted so that the milk solids and golden liquid 
        have been separated and can be used in place of vegetable oil to yield a more authentic taste.
