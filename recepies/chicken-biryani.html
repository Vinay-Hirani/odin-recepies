    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish which is often reserved for very special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. 
        <br>It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. 
        For biryani, always use long grain rice. 
        Basmati rice with its thin, fine grains is the ideal variety to use. 
        <br>Ghee is butter that has been slowly melted so that the milk solids and golden liquid 
        have been separated and can be used in place of vegetable oil to yield a more authentic taste.
