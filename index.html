    <h3>A Brief introduction to Indian Cuisine</h3>
    <p> Think of India and one of the first things that comes to mind is its diversity.<br> 
        A large country, its population is second only to China, 
        its languages are numerous and every state (of which there are 28 and seven Union territories) 
        is unique in its traditions and very importantly, its food.<br>
        In fact, food from one region may actually be totally alien to a person from another region! 
        The common thread that runs through most Indian food, though, 
        is the use of numerous spices to create flavor and aroma.
